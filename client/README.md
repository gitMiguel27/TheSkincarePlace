# The Skincare Place

## A ReactJS and Material UI front-end with Ruby on Rails back-end website about skin types, how to treat your skin type, and recommended products!

My goal with this project is to provide a straightforward manual for treating various skin types. The skin types this project focuses on are: Dry, Oily, Combination and Normal skin. This app will be the place where people new to skincare or even experienced people can go to for advice and recommendations.

As a user YOU can:
* Switch through different skin types (changes interface/navigates you to new interface)
* See recommended products based on your skin type
* Log-in and post my own skincare routine (coming soon!)

## Known issues (Work in progress)

This project is still ongoing. The login/sign-up feature is not set up yet, while it is implemented and featured in some components. The navbar responsiveness to a smaller screen is not functional at the moment. These are coming soon!
