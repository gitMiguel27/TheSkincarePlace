# The Skincare Place

## A ReactJS and Material UI Front-End with Ruby on Rails Back-End website. This is a resource for people wanting to start their skincare journeys!

The Skincare Place is THE place to go when you want to start your skincare journey. The goal with this project was to create a one-stop resource where you can find everything you are looking for - discover what your skin type is, how to treat your skin type, and what products to use. I know from experience how overwhelming starting a skincare routine can be, but I am here to support you in your journey.

As a user YOU can:
* Choose your skin type
* Read about your skin type
* Disocver recommended products

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4

Since this is my personal project, completed for the Mentorship Program with Out in Tech, I would advise for you to clone and rename this project to use for your own purposes.

## Known issues (Work in progress)

This project is still ongoing. I am figuring out the collapsing of the navbar menu. This is coming soon!
